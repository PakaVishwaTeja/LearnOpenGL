- opengl -> 3d space
- screen -> 2d surface pixels
- 3d coordinates ->2d pixels  transformation MANAGED BY graphics pipeline
- graphics pipeline : does transformation of
	- 3d space to 2d 
	- 2d coords to actual pixels

# steps
#### 1 we need triangle data
- 3 points in 3d space
- lets create vertices array having these 3 point's coordinates in `main.cpp` 
#### 2 load the data to gpu
but how?

- we need to create a buffer in gpu memory
	```
	glGenBuffers(1 , &VBO);
	```
- load vertex data to gpu buffer
```
	//bind vbo to curr context
	glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER,VBO); 
	
	//adding data to context == adding data to VBO 
	glBufferData(
	GL_ARRAY_BUFFER , 
	sizeof(vertices) ,
	vertices ,
	GL_STATIC_DRAW
	);
```
- need to tell gpu's program how to use this buffer. how?
- create vertex attribute pointer
```
glVertexAttribPointer(0,3,GL_FLOAT , GL_FALSE , 3 * sizeof(GLfloat) , 0);
glEnableVertexAttribArray(0);
```
- From the buffer ,this takes every  "3"  "float" values with "no rescaling" and 3\*size(float) bytes offset b/w consecutive attributes and gives to graphics pipeline at index "0" i.e  layout (location = 0)

#### 1.3 make Graphics pipeline so that gpu knows what to do with the data
- make vertex shader
	- in our case , vertex attributes at index = 0 is simply forwarded further
	- input   : vec3
	- output : gl_Position which is vec4
	- gl_Position if sent down the pipeline
```
#version 330 core
layout (location = 0) in vec3 aPos;
void main(){
  gl_Position = vec4(aPos.x, aPos.y, aPos.z, 1.0);
  }
```

- make fragment shader
	- output : FragColor which renders to screen!
```
#version 330 core
out vec4 FragColor;
void main(){
 FragColor = vec4(1.0f, 0.5f, 0.2f, 1.0f);
 }
```
 - compile these shaders
 - create shader program (i.e link shaders and make pipeline)
 - hooray! our graphics pipeline is ready!
