- add vertex data 
- modify vao accodingly
- bam! cube can be seen 
- PROBLEM :  depth is not considered
	- sol : 
		- `glEnable(GL_DEPTH_TEST);`
		- `glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT);`

draw more cubes:
- how?
	- can add more vertices , but we can use one cube specification and draw multiple cubes
	- in draw function, add cube position data and  then translate the cube accordingly in world space and draw the cube 
	- iterate this process to get multiple cubes :)
