to define camera we need:
- camera position in 3d space
- camera's direction (the direction which it is looking)
	- camera position - camera target will gives this
- right vector
	- (0,1,0) cross (direction)
- up vector
	- direction cross right
- and then we need to make view matrix which transforms world space to view space
- **open gl does this for us**
	- lookAt matrix
		- `view  = lookat(cameraPosition , target , up_worldspace)`\
now we can catch keyboard events and move out camera accordingly!
```
glm::vec3 cameraPos = glm::vec3(0.0f, 0.0f, 3.0f); 
glm::vec3 cameraFront = glm::vec3(0.0f, 0.0f, -1.0f); 
glm::vec3 cameraUp = glm::vec3(0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f);

view = glm::lookAt(cameraPos, cameraPos + cameraFront, cameraUp);

void processInput(GLFWwindow *window) { 
... 
const float cameraSpeed = 0.05f; // adjust accordingly 
if (glfwGetKey(window, GLFW_KEY_W) == GLFW_PRESS) 
cameraPos += cameraSpeed * cameraFront; 
if (glfwGetKey(window, GLFW_KEY_S) == GLFW_PRESS)
cameraPos -= cameraSpeed * cameraFront; 
if (glfwGetKey(window, GLFW_KEY_A) == GLFW_PRESS)
cameraPos -= glm::normalize(glm::cross(cameraFront, cameraUp)) * cameraSpeed; 
if (glfwGetKey(window, GLFW_KEY_D) == GLFW_PRESS) 
cameraPos += glm::normalize(glm::cross(cameraFront, cameraUp)) * cameraSpeed; }


```

we can place our camera whereever we want with these things
- problem : direction lock , cant move freely
- solution:
	-  we need to specify direction
	- we will use YAW and PITCH

```
yaw = -90.0f;
pitch = 0.0f;

direction.x = cos(glm::radians(yaw)) * cos(glm::radians(pitch)); 
direction.y = sin(glm::radians(pitch)); 
direction.z = sin(glm::radians(yaw)) * cos(glm::radians(pitch));

cameraFront = glm::normalize(direction);

```

and we will adjust this Euler angles based on mouse movements!
